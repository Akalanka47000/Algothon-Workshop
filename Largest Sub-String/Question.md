You are given a string S of N length . Each character of the string is either 0 or 1. Now, you need to select the largest substring in which the count of 0 in the string is more than the count of 1. Print the maximum possible length of the subarray in the output.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N as input. The next line contains a string comprising of 0 and 1. The length of this string is exactly N.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5

Output Format

In the output print the length of the largest substring in which the count of 0 is more than 1.
