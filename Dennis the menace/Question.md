Assuming that you are given bricks sizes as Integers in an Array, You have to calculated max size with exactly N bricks.

In other words

Given an array of integers and N(a number)find the maximum value that can be calculated by summing exactly N numbers.

Example

Input Array - [10, 11, 5, 20, 4]

N - 2

Output- 31

Explanation

You have to find the max sum which can be calculated using 2 numbers in the array. 11 + 20 = 31

Input Format

First line is a String with with spaces Second line is an Integer

Constraints

1 < N < Array.length

Output Format

Integer

Sample Input 0

2 10 5 6 7
