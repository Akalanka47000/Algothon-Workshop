King of the Ring recently happened. And with it, happened one of the biggest heartbreaks for the fans around the world. The Triple H undefeated streak was finally over.

Now as an Triple H fan, you're disappointed, disheartened and shattered to pieces. And Little Jhool doesn't want to upset you in any way possible. (After all you are his only friend) Little Jhool knows that you're still sensitive to the loss, so he decides to help you out.

Every time you come across a number, Little Jhool carefully manipulates it. He doesn't want you to face numbers which have "16" as a part of them. Or, in the worst case possible, are divisible by 16.

If you end up facing such a number you feel sad... and no one wants that - because you start chanting "Oh man this is horrable" , if the number doesn't make you feel sad, you say, "Its perfect dude"

Help Little Jhool so that he can help you!
